## Short about the game NOWAY
#### NOWAY is a runner-shooter that stands out for its special dynamics.

The main idea is to run, destroy, kill. The visual and gameplay style of the game is inspired by Doom, UltraKill and PS1 games.
Dynamics, chaos and the desire to satisfy your inner hatred for the world - this is what we want to give you. 

The idea for the game itself came about during a game jam, where work on the NOWAY prototype began. 
We have already started rewriting all the code from scratch to optimize and make the game work correctly.

## Plans
♡ Recode absolutely all code with maximum optimization so that everyone can enjoy the NOWAY gameplay.<br>
♡ Variety of locations every 100 levels.<br>
♡ Choosing a weapon and leg before starting the race.<br>
♡ Different types of enemies and obstacles.<br>
♡ More objects to interact with.<br>
